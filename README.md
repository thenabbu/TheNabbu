# Hello!

Just a dev trying to develop better tools and scripts

## About Me

I’m a full-stack web developer with strong interests in UI/UX design, graphic design, and backend scripting. I enjoy building polished, practical systems and automating repetitive tasks. My focus is on clean design, lean code, and fast delivery.

I’m currently exploring new project ideas, improving my TypeScript and automation skills, and contributing to my own open-source tools.

## Core Skills

- Full-Stack Web Development (Next.js, Flask, TailwindCSS, SQL, MongoDB)
- UI/UX Design (Figma, Canva, clean and responsive interfaces)
- Graphic Design (event branding, social content)
- Automation and Scripting (Python, Node.js for scraping, cron jobs, CLI tools)
- Technical Optimization (low-end system tuning, Docker-based services, self-hosted setups)
